Footprinting:
  ‣ Gathering as much publicly availabe information as possible about a target (DNS, WHOIS, Google, etc.)
  ‣ This includes gathering informatin such as:
    a) IP addresses
    b) Domain names
    c) Subdomains

  ‣ Objectives of footprinting:
    a) To know the security posture : Find out the security controls/tools/policies in place.
    b) To reduce the focus area     : Find out what parts of the network are in scope (allowed to be tested).
    c) Identify vulnerabilities     : Discover the vulnerabilities present in the network.
    d) Draw a network map           : Figure out what systems are connected to each other.

  ‣ Mitigations of footprinting:
    • Avoid publishing sensitive information online.
    • Disable geotagging on photos posted online.
    • Shred documents before disposing them.
    • Shutdown unnecessary services
    • Monitor for scanning activities

  ‣ Sequence of steps for footprinting:
    1) Gather information           : Collecting all available information about the target
    2) Locate the network range     : Finding out the IP address range a target uses
    3) Discover active machines     : After finding the network range, find all its active machines
    4) Determine operating systems  : Determine the operating systems of the active machines
    5) Define running services      : Find out services (databases, web servers, etc.) running on the machines
    6) Map the network              : Create a visual representation of the network topology

Tools/methodologies discussed in this lecture:
  1) Information Gathering:
    a) Job postings
      • Information about the company's network can be found in job postings (Azure Administrator, etc.)

    b) Competitive intelligence:
      • Discovering threats and vulnerabilities in a competitor's network.
      • This can be then used to improve the security posture of your own network.
      • For example, lets consider that the target is BOC and it's competitor is HNB:
        i)    HNB recently had a security breach due to a vulnerability in their web server.
        ii)   Upon investigation, you discover that the same vulnerability exists in BOC's network.
        iii)  You can then use this information to improve the security posture of BOC's network.

    c) Investigating Emails:
      ‣ Reading email headers of target's email will reveal:
        1) Is the target vulnerable to email spoofing:
          • Email spoofing is when an attacker changes the "From" header to disguise as someone else.
          • To prevent this, SPF (Sender Policy Framework) can be used.
            • This is a database of IP addresses allowed to send emails on behalf of a domain.

    d) Google Hacking:
      • Search operators such as the following can be used to gather sensitive data:
        ╔═════════════════╦═════════════════════════════════════════════╗
        ║ Search operator ║ Purpose                                     ║
        ╠═════════════════╬═════════════════════════════════════════════╣
        ║ site:           ║ Search for a specific domain                ║
        ║ related:        ║ Find websites that are related to a domain  ║
        ║ cache:          ║ Find cached versions of a webpage           ║
        ║ allintext:      ║ Find pages that contain a specific keyword  ║
        ║ intext:         ║ Find documents with a specific keyword      ║
        ║ allinurl:       ║ URLs with a specific keyword                ║
        ║ allintitle:     ║ Pages with a specific keyword in the title  ║
        ║ filetype:       ║ Find documents of a specific file type      ║
        ╚═════════════════╩═════════════════════════════════════════════╝
      • This can reveal sensitive data such as usernames & passwords. For example:
        a) allintext:username filetype:log  (Find all log files that contain the word "username")
        b) db_password filetype:env         (Find all environment files that contain the word "db_password")

    e) DNS Footprinting: Using tools such as DNSDumpster & DNSRecon to find DNS records of a target
        ╔══════════╦══════════════════════════════════════════╗
        ║ Record   ║ Purpose                                  ║
        ╠══════════╬══════════════════════════════════════════╣
        ║ A        ║ Maps a domain name to an IP address      ║
        ║ MX       ║ Maps a domain name to a mail server      ║
        ║ NS       ║ Maps a domain name to a name server      ║
        ║ CNAME    ║ Maps an alias to a domain name           ║
        ║ SRV      ║ Maps a domain name to a service location ║
        ║ PTR      ║ Maps an IP address to a domain name      ║
        ║ HINFO    ║ Stores hardware/OS information           ║
        ╚══════════╩══════════════════════════════════════════╝
        ‣ Other DNS Threats:
          a) Zone file compromise : Attacker modifies the zone file to redirect traffic to a malicious server.
          c) Cache poisoning      : Attacker modifies the DNS cache to redirect traffic to a malicious server.
          b) Flood attack         : Attacker sends a large number of DNS requests to a server to overload it.

    f) OSINT Tools        : Shodan, Censys, etc. are used to gather publicly available info about a target.
    g) Pipl Search        : A search engine that can be used to find personal info about people.
    h) Social engineering : Using deception to obtain sensitive information (phishing, pharming, etc.)
    i) Online reputation  : Twitter alerts, Google alerts, etc. show the online reputation of a target.
    j) Website mirroring  : Downloading a copy of a website to analyze it offline.
    k) Traffic monitoring : Tools such as Alexa & Google Analytics show visitor statistics of a website.
