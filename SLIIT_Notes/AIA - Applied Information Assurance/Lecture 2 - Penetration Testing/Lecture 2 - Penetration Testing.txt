a) Penetration Testing: A proactive security assessment that tests internal and external systems by simulating an attack.
  ‣ Types of penetration testing:
    a) Black Box Testing  : The tester has no knowledge of the system under test.
    b) White Box Testing  : The tester has full knowledge of the system under test.
    c) Gray Box Testing   : The tester has some knowledge of the system under test.

  ‣ Stages of penetration testing:
    a) Pre-Engagement         : Preparing the test environment and the tools to be used.
    b) Information Gathering  : Gathering information about the target system (aka footprinting).
    c) Vulnerability Analysis : Finding system and application weaknesses to recognize vulnerabilities.
    d) Threat Modeling        : Making a list of threats and vulnerabilities.
        i)    Objective Identification  : Figuring out the objective of the penetration test.
        ii)   Application Overview      : Finding out how the application works.
        iii)  Decompose Application     : Breaking down the application into smaller parts.
        iv)   Identify Threats          : Finding out the threats to the application.
        v)    Identify Vulnerabilities  : Finding out the vulnerabilities to the application.

    e) Exploitation           : Using the vulnerabilities found in the previous stage to gain access to the system.
    f) Post Exploitation      : Gaining access to the system and maintaining it.
    g) Reporting              : Reporting the results of the test to the client.

  ‣ Goals of a penetration test
    a) Proactive testing of systems by simulating attacks
    b) Review policies and procedures

b) Risk: The monetary value of the loss that can be caused by a threat.
  ‣ Formalized as (Risk = Threat * Vulnerability):
    a) Threat         : The probability of a party (employee, hacker, etc) having malicious intent.
                          ‣ A disgruntled employee, a hacker, etc.

    b) Vulnerability  : The probability of a security flaw compromising the system.
                          ‣ A weak password, a buffer overflow, etc.

  ‣ Managing risk: The process of reducing risk on tangible and intangible assets.
    a) Tangible assets  : Physical assets such as buildings, equipment, and vehicles.
    b) Intangible assets: Non-physical assets such as brand value, customer relationships, etc..
