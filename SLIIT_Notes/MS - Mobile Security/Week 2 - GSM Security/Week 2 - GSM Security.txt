Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM): A network architecture that provides mobile communication services

Components of GSM:
  1) Mobile Station (MS)                : The actual mobile phone system
    a) Mobile Equipment (ME)            : The physical components of the mobile phone (display, keypad, microphone, etc.)
    b) Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) : A smart card that stores user data & the needed algorithms for authentication

  2) Base Station Subsystem (BSS)       : Handles the radio interface between the phone and the network

    a) Base Transceiver Station (BTS)   : The physical signal tower that sends/receives radio signals to/from the phone
      ‣ It is responsible for modulating/demodulating (converts analog to digital and vice versa) signals to/from the phone
      ‣ When a request to make a call is made, the MS sends a request to the BTS to create the call

    b) Base Station Controller (BSC)    : A device that manages and controls multiple BTSs
      ‣ It is responsible for paging the MS when there is an incoming call (sending a signal to the MS to wake it up)
      ‣ It is responsible for handover (transfer of a call from one BTS to another) when the MS moves to a new BTS

  3) Network & Switching Subsystem (NSS): Responsible for core network functions and switching/routing of calls 

    a) Mobile Switching Center (MSC)    : A phone switching center that handles call routing and switching
      ‣ The wired backbone of the GSM network which connects all the MSCs together
      ‣ When a user makes a call/message, the MSC is responsible for routing it to the right destination

    b) Home Location Register (HLR)     : A database that stores the user's identity/location information
      ‣ The central database of all users on the GSM network
      ‣ HLR stores the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) and static data of each user

    c) Visitor Location Register (VLR)  : A temporary database that stores data of new users who roam into the network
      ‣ When an MS enters a new geographic area/network, the VLR looks for the user's information in the central HLR
      ‣ It then stores a temporary copy of that infromation in the VLR
      ‣ For example, if Ananda, a Mobitel user, goes to Australia and switches on his phone:
          • The phone sees the available networks and sends a request to the Vodafone network in Australia.
          • Vodafone sends a request to Mobitel's HLR as Ananda's SIM is not registered with the Vodafone network.
          • Mobitel's HLR sends the subscriber information to Vodafone.
          • Vodafone now stores this information in it's VLR, enabling Ananda to roam to Australia and make calls.

    d) Authentication Center (AUC)      : Stores the user's authentication information
      ‣ The AUC is responsible for authenticating the user's identity
      ‣ It is associated with the HLR (which stores the user's identity information)

    e) Equipment Identity Register (EIR): Stores the user's equipment information
      ‣ The EIR is a database which stores the user's equipment (ME) information (IMEI number)
      ‣ It is located in the HLR (which stores the user's identity information)

Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK): A modulation technique used in GSM (converts analog signals to digital signals)
  ‣ Data is converted to a binary stream of 0s and 1s, which is an analog signal, which cannot be sent over the air
  ‣ For every 0, the carrier frequency is shifted down by a certain amount
  ‣ For every 1, the carrier frequency is shifted up by a certain amount
  ‣ This will result in a frequency wave that can be sent over the air

Cellular Technologies:
  1) 2G - 3G:
      a) GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) - 2.5G
      b) EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) - 2.75G
      c) UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) - 3G

  2) 4G - 5G
      a) 4G HSPA+ (High Speed Packet Access)
      b) 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution)

GSM Authentication:
  1) International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI): A 15-digit number assigned to each SIM card
      ‣ It is stored in the SIM card and is used to authenticate the user and is a permanent identifier.
      ‣ The IMSI is sent out to a BTS when the user requests a service.
      ‣ However, sending the IMSI every time a device communicates with the network can pose a privacy risk
      ‣ It can be intercepted by a third party who may be able to track the user's location and other information
      ‣ To combat this privacy problem, a Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) is used instead.

  2) Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI): Used instead of IMSI to ensure anonymity
      ‣ The network assigns a TMSI to a user when the user first registers with the network.
      ‣ Unlike an IMSI, the TMSI is temporary and is only valid for a certain period of time.
      ‣ The TMSI is sent instead of the IMSI, and therefore the private IMSI is not sent out to the BTS.

Security services provided in a SIM:
  1) PIN (Personal Identification Number)
      ‣ A user must enter a PIN before using the SIM card.
      ‣ Once the PIN is entered, the SIM card is unlocked and the user can make calls, send messages, etc.

  2) Network challenge and response
      ‣ A shared secret key (Kᵢ) is available for each SIM which is stored securely in the AUC and in the SIM
      ‣ The mobile phone sends it's IMSI to a BTS requesting to authenticate the user.
      ‣ The IMSI is then forwarded from the BTS -> BSC -> MSC -> HLR/VLR -> AUC
      ‣ The AUC generates a triplet (three random numbers) and stores it in the VLR
          • RAND  (Random number)     - A random number generated by the AUC
          • XRES  (Expected response) - Contains the result of the XOR operation between the Kᵢ and RAND
          • Kᶜ    (Ciphering key)     - A key used to encrypt the data sent over the air
      ‣ The MSC then sends only the RAND to the mobile phone
      ‣ The mobile phone uses its Kᵢ to XOR the RAND and sends the result (RES) to the MSC
      ‣ The MSC then compares the RES with the XRES stored in the VLR
      ‣ If the both match, the user is authenticated

Encryption in GSM (A5 Algorithm):
  ‣ Data transmitted through air between the MS and BSS is encrypted using the A5 algorithm
  ‣ The A5 algorithm is a stream cipher which uses a 64-bit key (Kᶜ) to encrypt the data

  Components of the A5 keystream (Kᶜ):
    a) Session key: A temporary key which is generated every time a new call to the network is made
      ‣ When authentication is successful, the MSC sends the Kᶜ to the mobile phone
      ‣ It is used to encrypt the data sent over the air

    b) Frame key: A key generated using the frame number and the session key to encrypt entire 114-bit frames
      ‣ GSM frames are sent in 114-bit blocks, each block is encrypted with a frame key (session key + frame number)
      ‣ If data of size 1140 bits were to be sent over the network:
        i)    The first 114 bits of data will be encrypted using the session key (Kᶜ) and the frame number (1)
        ii)   The next 114 bits of data will be encrypted using the session key (Kᶜ) and the frame number (2)
        iii)  This goes on until all the data is sent

Two ways to break GSM:
  1) Active intercept: Setting up a fake BTS and intercepting the data
      ‣ This involves creating a fake BTS with a stronger signal than the real BTS
      ‣ The victim MS connect to the fake BTS, which will expose the session key and the frame key

  2) Passive intercept: Listening to the data sent over the air
      ‣ An attacker could eavesdrop and record the data sent over the air between the victim MS and the BTS
      ‣ The attacker can then attempt to recover the session key and the frame key

Problems with GSM Security:
	a) Active attacks							: Attacks using a Fake BTS is possible
	b) Key transmission						: Encryption keys (XRES, Kc, RAND) are not encrypted in-transit
	c) Limited encryption scope		: Encryption is not applied to all the data sent over the air
	d) Channel hijack							: An attacker can take control of a channel and block connections
	e) Implicit data integrity		: Data sent over GSM is not guaranteed to have integrity
	f) Unilateral authentication	: Only the network authenticates the user, not the other way around
	g) Weak encryption algorithms	: A5 algorithm is weak and can be broken (short keylengths)
	h) Unsecured terminal					: Malwares and viruses installed on the MS can read the data sent over the air
