1. Use the Internet to study the GSM phase out plans worldwide.
  a) What is the reason for developing countries to delay the GSM switch off?
    • High cost of upgrading their existing infrastructure to newer technologies.
    • Lack of financial resources to invest in new technologies.
    • Limited availability of compatible devices for newer technologies.
    • Dependence on GSM for critical services such as emergency calls and public safety communications.
    • Reliance on GSM for rural and remote areas with limited coverage of newer technologies.

  b) Find the reason why GSM might outlive 3G as a service in some parts of the world.
    • GSM has wider coverage and is more cost-effective than 3G.
    • Many users still rely on basic voice and messaging services, which GSM provides efficiently.
    • GSM is backward compatible, which means that newer devices can still access GSM networks.
    • This makes it easier for users to switch to newer devices without having to switch to newer networks

2. Explain why GSM cannot provide the users with end to end voice encryption.
  • Encryption only occurs between the mobile device and the base station
  • The communication between the base stations and the core network is not encrypted
  • This means that the voice traffic is vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping
  • Also, the encryption key is shared among multiple base stations
  • This makes it easier for attackers to intercept and decrypt the communication

3. What is the relationship between Home Location Register (HLR) and Visitor Location Register (VLR) ?
  • HLR and VLR are two databases in the GSM network that store subscriber information
  • The HLR is the main database that stores the subscriber's phone number, IMSI, location, and other information
  • The VLR is a temporary database that stores a copy of the information in the HLR
  • The VLR is usually used when the subscriber is roaming in another network (moving away from his home network)
  • The network uses the information in both the HLR and VLR to route the communication to the subscriber

4. What is the importance of the PIN number of the SIM module?
  • The PIN in the SIM protects the SIM card from fraudulent activity
  • The PIN is a four-digit code that the user enters to access the SIM card's services
  • If the wrong pin is entered multiple times, the SIM card is locked

5. Draw a diagram reflecting the GSM Authentication process.
• Network challenge and response
  ‣ A shared secret key (Kᵢ) is available for each SIM which is stored securely in the AUC and in the SIM
  ‣ The mobile phone sends it's IMSI to a BTS requesting to authenticate the user.
  ‣ The IMSI is then forwarded from the BTS -> BSC -> MSC -> HLR/VLR -> AUC
  ‣ The AUC generates a triplet (three random numbers) and stores it in the VLR
      • RAND  (Random number)     - A random number generated by the AUC
      • XRES  (Expected response) - Contains the result of the XOR operation between the Kᵢ and RAND
      • Kᶜ    (Ciphering key)     - A key used to encrypt the data sent over the air
  ‣ The MSC then sends only the RAND to the mobile phone
  ‣ The mobile phone uses its Kᵢ to XOR the RAND and sends the result (RES) to the MSC
  ‣ The MSC then compares the RES with the XRES stored in the VLR
  ‣ If the both match, the user is authenticated

6. Explain why attackers may carry out known plain-text attacks against A5/1 ciphers.
  • Attackers may carry out known plain-text attacks against A5/1 ciphers because A5/1 is vulnerable to such attacks.
  • In a known plain-text attack, the attacker has access to both
    a) The plaintext (the original message)
    b) The corresponding ciphertext (the encrypted message)

  • The attacker can use this knowledge to deduce the secret key used for encryption.
