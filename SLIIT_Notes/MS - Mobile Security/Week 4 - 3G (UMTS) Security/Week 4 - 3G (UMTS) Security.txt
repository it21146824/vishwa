2) UMTS Network Architecture:
	a) User Equipment (UE): The physical mobile device

	b) UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN): The radio network that connects the UE to the network
		i) Node B: The physical signal tower that sends/receives radio signals to UEs in a cell
			• A cell is a geographical area that is covered by a Node B
			• A Node B is connected to a Radio Network Controller (RNC) using a Iub interface
			• This is responsible for functions such as:
				a) Modulation/Demodulation: Converting digital signals to analog signals and vice versa
				b) Traffic data collection: Collecting data about the traffic in the cell
				c) Soft/hard Handover			: Transferring a call/data session from one station to another station
					i) Soft Handover	: Connection is maintained in both stations and the call is gradually transferred
					ii) Hard Handover	: Connection is disconnected from original station and transfered to the new station

		ii) Radio Network Controller (RNC): The controller that manages multiple Node Bs
			• It is responsible for managing the radio resources of the UTRAN (handover, power control, etc.)
			• Two or more RNCs can be connected together using an Iur interface
			• The RNC is connected to the Core Network (CN) using an Iu interface
			• This is responsible for functions such as:
				a) Diversity Handover			: A UE is handed over from one cell to another without losing connection
				b) Call connecton control	: Setup and release procedures for calls while maintaining call quality

		iii) Radio Network Subsystem (RNS): Logically separating RNCs in different geographical areas
			• It is a logical grouping of one RNC connected to one or more Node Bs in an area.
			• Just like IP networks are grouped into subnets, multiple RNCs are grouped into RNSs.
			• Like IP networks use IP addresses, RNS uses RNSIs to identify the RNS

		iv) Interfaces: The physical connections between the Node B, RNC, and CN
			• Iub interface		: A copper wire that connects the Node B to the Radio Network Controller (RNC)
			• Iu interface		: A fiber optic cable that connects the RNC to the Core Network (CN)
			• Iur interface		: A copper wire that is used to connect two or more RNCs together
	
	c) Core Network (CN): This is the backbone of the UMTS network
		i) Mobile Switching Center / Visitor Location Register (MSC/VLR):
			• Used to route calls using the best route and stores the current location of the UE
			• When a user requests a call, the MSC determines the best route for incoming calls
			• The VLR is a temporary database that stores data about UE that roams into a network

		ii) Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN): Connects the UMTS network to the internet and other networks
			• Located at the edge of a network acting as a gateway between the UMTS network and external networks
			• Is responsible for handling the data packets that enter/leave the UMTS network

		iii) Gateway Mobile Switching Center (GMSC): Connects the UMTS network to the PSTN
			• Located at the edge of a network acting as a gateway between the UMTS network and the PSTN
			• PSTN is a worldwide circuit-switched network that connects telephones to each other

		iv) Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN): Routes data packets between mobile devices and networking services
			• Located at the core of the UMTS network
			• It is responsible for controlling mobile devices connected to GPRS and managing their data transmission

		v) Home Location Register (HLR): The central database of the network
			• A central database that stores subscriber data, including subscriber profiles, and location information.

		vi) Authentication Center (AuC): Authenticates the UE
			• It is responsible for generating and managing the security keys to authenticate the subscriber

3) Noise in wireless communications and solutions:
	a) Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)
		• A type of noise that reduces signal quality in wireless communications
		• Typically caused by thermal noise, interference, and background radiation (e.g. cosmic rays)
		• A gaussian (normal) distribution is used to model the noise, but there are some problems with this model:
			• Multipath echo/fading (interference from trees, buildings, etc) are not taken into account
			• Therefore, the noise is never a gaussian (normal) in cellular network communications
	
	b) Multipath Channel
		• Sound waves can take multiple paths from a destination to a source (reflect off trees, buildings, etc)
		• Therefore, the received signal will be:
			a) Echoed (Multipath Echo)	: Reflection of the signal off different surfaces and received at different times
			b) Faded (Multipath Fading)	: Signal strength changes due to interference
	
	c) RAKE Receiver
		• A signal processing technique used to combat signals taking a multipath channel
		• The RAKE receiver has multiple antennas that receive all multipath echoes
		• Once all signals are received from these antennas, it will merge all multipath signals to one signal
		• This will improve signal quality and signal strength

4) New features in UMTS
	a) User Confidentiality (TMSI)
		• The UE is assigned a temporary mobile subscriber identity (TMSI)
		• This is done in order to hide the UE's IMSI in communications
			1) VLR requests the user for its IMSI
			2) The user sends its IMSI to the VLR
			3) The VLR stores the IMSI and sends a TMSI to the user
			4) The user acknowledges the VLR that it received the TMSI
	
	b) Mutual Authentication: Both the network and mobile device authenticate themselves
		• The authentication process is called Authentication & Key Agreement (AKA):
			1) The network starts a User Authentication Request by sending the following to the UE:
				a) RAND (Random Number)
				b) AUTN (Authentication Token which contains the AMF & MAC)

			2) The UE then calculates the following keys:
				a) AK (Anonimity Key)		: Calculated using the secret key in the USIM (K) and the RAND
				b) SQN (Sequence Number): The number of times data was sent out (similar to TCP SQN)
				c) XMAC (Expected MAC)	: Calculated using the secret key (K), SQN, RAND, AMF

			• If the calculated XMAC and the received MAC same, the network was authenticated
			• Else, if the SQN is not in range, send a synchronization failure

			3) If the XMAC matches the MAC, the mobile generates a RES and sends the RES to the network
			4) If the RES matches the XRES (Expected response) in the network's VLR, the UE is authenticated
	
	c) Data Integrity						: Both the UE and network agree on an IK (Integrity Key) to verify data
	d) Data Confidentiality			: Both IE and network agree on a CK (Cipher Key) to encrypt data
	e) IMEI Protection					: IMEI is sent only after authentication
	f) User-USIM Authentication	: Users should authenticate themselves with a PIN number to access the SIM
	g) Visibility								: If a base-station does not encrypt its data, a warning should be shown on the UE
	h) Secure Applications			: Sensistive data is always encrypted end-to-end and is therefore secure

5) A5 Encryption (stream cipher)
  I) Versions of A5
    a) A5/0: Allows GSM to make calls without encryption (not a release)
    b) A5/1: The original A5 algorithm used in Western Europe & US
    c) A5/2: Second version of A5 used outside of Europe & US
    d) A5/3: A stronger version of A5 used in 3G networks
