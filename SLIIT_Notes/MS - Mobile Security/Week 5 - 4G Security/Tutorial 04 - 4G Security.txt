1) How does 4G LTE authentication work, and what are the different methods used in the network?
	1) NAS Attach Request (UE -> eNB -> MME): The UE attempts to connect to the network using its IMSI
  2) AUTH Data Request (MME -> AuC)       : The IMSI is forwarded to the AuC along with a SN_ID (sequence number)
  3) AUTH Data Response (AuC -> MME)      : The AuC return the following data to the MME based on the UE's IMEI
        1) AUTN   : A value that is generated by XORing the RAND, KASME, SN_ID
        2) XRES   : The expected response from the UE
        3) KASME  : A shared key used to encrypt the NAS messages (available on both the UE and MME)
        4) RAND   : A random number generated by the network

  4) NAS Authentication Request (MME -> eNB -> UE): The MME sends the following data to the UE for authentication
        1) RAND   : A random number generated by the network
        2) AUTN   : A value that is generated by XORing the RAND, KASME, SN_ID
        3) KSIASME: Generated by XORing the KASME and KSI (a 3-bit value incremented for every authentication request)

  5)  NAS Authentication Response  (UE -> eNB -> MME)  : The UE calculates a response to the challenge and sends (RES)
  6)  NAS SMC                      (MME -> eNB -> UE)  : The encryption algorithms for MME -> UE communications is sent
  7)  NAS Security Mode Complete   (UE -> eNB -> MME)  : The UE configures the algorithms and sends confirmation to the MME
  8)  S1AP Initial Context Setup Request (MME -> eNB)  : Signals the eNB to start sharing encryption algorithms from eNB -> UE 
  9)  RRC SMC                             (eNB -> UE)  : eNB shares encryption algorithms with UE
  10) RRC Security Complete               (UE -> eNB)  : eNB acknowledges receipt of the encryption algorithms

2) What are the potential risks and threats associated with 4G LTE authentication, and how do they work?
    I) Threats
      A) Cloning of credentials     : SIM card cloning, obtaining IMSI number, etc.
      B) Physical tampering         : The eNB can be damaged by a physical attack (e.g. a hammer, fire)
      C) Fraudulent software update : Attackers can gain root access to eNB using a malicious software update
      D) Man-in-the-middle attacks  : Attacker can listen and change the data being sent between the UE and eNB
      E) DDOS Attacks               : A large number of fake users can be created to overload the network
      F) Eavesdropping              : An IMSI catcher can be used to eavesdrop on the network

    II) Characteristics
      A) Re-use of UMTS AKA: Same AKA process as in UMTS (3G)
      B) Use of USIM required                     : A special SIM card (USIM) is required for LTE
      C) Extended key hierarchy                   : A more complex key hierarchy than in 3G & provides greater security
      D) Possibility for longer keys              : The algorithms used in LTE (EIA 1/2/3) support longer keys
      E) Greater protection for backhaul          : The part that connects the eNB to the core network is more secure
      F) Integrated security for legacy networks  : Designed to work with 2G and 3G
      G) Unencrypted communication warning        : The UE will be warned if communication to eNB is not encrypted

3) How effective is SIM-based authentication in preventing unauthorized access to the network?
    • SIM based authentication is when:
      1) The UE sends its IMSI to the AuC
      2) The AuC sends a RAND (challenge) to the UE
      3) The UE calculates the RAND with its shared key (K) and sends it to the network (response)
      3) If the sent response matches the network's expected response, the device is authenticated

    • Each SIM card is uniquely tied to a user's account, and makes it harder for attackers to clone user identity

4) What is AKA-based authentication, and how does it compare to other authentication methods in terms of security?
    • AKA is a more secure authentication method than SIM-based authentication
    • AKA also follows a challenge-response mechanism, but includes more communications and is usually encrypted
    • Therefore, AKA-based authentication is more secure than SIM based authentication
