I) The goals/features of LTE
  a) Packet domain services only      : Only supports IP-based services such as internet access, VoIP, video streaming, etc..
  b) High bandwidth / User throughput : Focus on high speed data transfer rates
  c) Low latency                      : Data sent from one device to another should be received as soon as possible
  d) Improved spectral efficiency     : More data can be transferred over the same frequency (Using MIMO & OFDMA)
  e) Mobility                         : Moving from one area to another without losing connectivity (handover)
  f) Multimedia broadcast/services    : Broadcasting multimedia content to multiple users simultaneously
  g) Spectrum flexibility             : The ability to use different frequency bands for different services
  h) Multi-antenna configurations     : Multiple antennas are used to improve the performance of the network
  i) Higher coverage and frequency    : The ability to use higher frequencies to increase the coverage area of the network
