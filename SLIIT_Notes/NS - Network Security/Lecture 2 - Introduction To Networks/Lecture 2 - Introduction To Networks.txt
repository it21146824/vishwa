1) Network Topologies: The physical or logical arrangement of devices, nodes, and links in a network
  a) Bus
  b) Ring
  c) Star
  d) Mesh
  e) Hybrid
  f) Tree

2) Network Communication
  ‣ There are four main components of network communication
    1) Message        : The data being sent
    2) Source         : The device sending the message
    3) Destination    : The device receiving the message
    4) Medium/Channel : The physical path the message travels (wire, fiber, air, etc.)

  ‣ There are two types of network devices
    1) End Devices          : Send and receive messages (PCs, printers, etc.)
    2) Intermediate Devices : Send, receive, and also forward messages to other devices
      a) Switches   : Used to filter and forward traffic in a LAN
      b) Routers    : Used to filter and forward traffic in a WAN

3) Switching Process
  i)   The switch reverses bits       (due to big/little endianness)
  ii)  Decodes the ethernet frame     (reads source/destination MAC)
  iii) Checks FCS - Discard if errors (verifies frame integrity)
  iv)  Check source MAC address       (update if not present)
  v)   Check MAC address table for MAC
        • If present, forward to port
        • If not present, flood to all ports

4) Routing Process
  i)   Router receives data                     (from switch or other router)
  ii)  Encode bits to create frame              (add a header and a trailer)
  iii) Check destination MAC and FCS            (verify frame integrity)
  iv)  Decapsulate the frame to get the packet  (remove header and trailer)
  v)   Check destination IP and routing table
        • If not found, send error message
        • If found:
          • Encapsulate packet into frame       (add header and trailer)
          • Transmit frame through correct port (based on MAC address and routing table)

5) Networking Media
  ‣ There are two types of networking transmission media
    a) Unguided (wireless)

    b) Guided (wired)
      i)   Twisted Pair       -> Copper cable
      ii)  Coaxial Cable      -> Copper cable
      iii) Fiber Optic Cable  -> Glass cable

6) Topology Diagrams
  a) Physical Topology Diagrams : Show the physical layout of the network (cables, switches, routers, etc.)
  b) Logical Topology Diagrams  : Show the logical layout of the network (IP addresses, subnets, interfaces, etc.)

7) Network Types
  a) Local Area Network (LAN) : A network that connects devices within a small geographic area (e.g. a building)
  b) Wide Area Network (WAN)  : A network that connects devices over a large geographic area (e.g. a city, country, etc.)
  c) Intranet                 : A private network accessed by authorized users in an organization
  d) Extranet                 : A private network which allows external users to access some parts of the network

8) Traditional Networks & Converged Networks
  a) Traditional Networks : Uses different technologies, protocols, and devices for each type of network traffic
  b) Converged Networks   : Uses the same technology, protocol, and device for all types of network traffic

9) Reliable Networks
  ‣ There are four basic characteristics of network architecture
    a) Fault Tolerance          : A network's ability to continue operating even if some of its components fail
    b) Scalability              : A network's ability to grow in size and complexity without losing performance
    c) Security                 : A network's ability to protect its data from unauthorized access
    d) Quality of Service (QoS) : A network's ability to provide different levels of service to different types of traffic

10) Reference Model For Network Communications (OSI Model, TCP/IP Model)
  ‣ A conceptual framework that provides a common language and structure for network communication
  ‣ It is used to understand how different components of a network work together to transfer data between devices
  ‣ Such a model typically defines:
    a) The format/structure of a message
    b) How networking devices share pathway information
    c) How and when error/system messages are generated
    d) The setup and termination of a connection

  ‣ Some benefits of using a layered model are:
    • Provides a common language                        (e.g. "layer 1" means the same thing to everyone)
    • Eliminates competition between different vendors  (e.g. all vendors use the same model)
    • Changes in one layer do not affect other layers   (e.g. changes in layer 1 do not affect layer 2)

  a) ISO/OSI Model
    1) Application Layer  : Provides services to applications (e.g. HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.)
    2) Presentation Layer : Formatting data for presentation to the application layer (e.g. encryption, compression)
    3) Session Layer      : Responsible for establishing and managing connections between devices
    4) Transport Layer    : Ensuring reliable delivery by including error detection and correction (e.g. TCP, UDP)
    5) Network Layer      : Routes data packets between devices on different networks (e.g. IP, ICMP, etc.)
    6) Data Link Layer    : Transfers data frames between devices over a physical link (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)
    7) Physical Layer     : Transfers bits over a physical medium, such as a cable or wireless connection (copper, fiber)

  b) TCP/IP Model
    1) Application Layer    : Protocols that support specific network applications (e.g. HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.)
    2) Transport Layer      : Ensuring reliable delivery by including error detection and correction (e.g. TCP, UDP)
    3) Internet Layer       : Routes data packets between devices on different networks (e.g. IP, ICMP, etc.)
    4) Network Access Layer : Transfers data frames between devices over a physical link (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)
