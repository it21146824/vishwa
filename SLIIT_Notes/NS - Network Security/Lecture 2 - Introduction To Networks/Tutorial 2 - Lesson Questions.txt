1. Explain two criteria on which networks can be classified. 
  a. Scale    : Based on their geographical coverage, number of devices and users, and traffic volume.
  b. Topology : Based on the logical and physical arrangements of network connections.

2. Explain the sub criteria for each of these criteria
  a. Scale:
   • Geographical coverage        : LAN, MAN, WAN, Global Area Network (GAN)
   • Number of devices and users  : Personal Area Network, Home Area Network, Enterprise Network, Campus Network, etc.
   • Traffic volume               : Low data rate (LDTR), High data rate (HDTR), Ultra-High data rate (UHDTR)

  b. Topology:
   • Physical topology : Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, Tree, Hybrid
   • Logical topology  : Broadcast, Token Passing, Circuit Switching, Packet Switching, Message Passing

3. What is physical topology of a network?
   • The actual physical arrangement of the devices and cables in the network.
   • It describes how the devices are physically connected to one another.

4. What is the logical topology of a network?
   • The way that data is transmitted between devices in a network.
   • It describes the logical paths that data follows when it is transmitted between devices.

5. List and explain 3 advanced network topologies used in HPC
  a) Fat-Tree topology   : Can handle a large amount of data traffic, commonly used in data centers.
  b) Hypercube topology  : Uses binary encoding to create a network of nodes arranged in a hypercube shape.
  c) Torus topology      : Uses a grid of interconnected nodes, with wraparound connections to form a torus shape.

6. List and explain the 4 main elements of network communication
    1) Message        : The data being sent
    2) Source         : The device sending the message
    3) Destination    : The device receiving the message
    4) Medium/Channel : The physical path the message travels (wire, fiber, air, etc.)

7. List and differentiate between 2 intermediate network devices 
  a) Hub     : Connects multiple devices on a network and broadcasts data to all connected devices.
  b) Bridge  : Connects two separate network segments and filters data to prevent unnecessary traffic.

8. Explain the process used by a router and a switch
  • Process used by a switch
    i)   The switch reverses bits       (due to big/little endianness)
    ii)  Decodes the ethernet frame     (reads source/destination MAC)
    iii) Checks FCS - Discard if errors (verifies frame integrity)
    iv)  Check source MAC address       (update if not present)
    v)   Check MAC address table for MAC
          • If present, forward to port
          • If not present, flood to all ports

  • Process used by a router
    i)   Router receives data                     (from switch or other router)
    ii)  Encode bits to create frame              (add a header and a trailer)
    iii) Check destination MAC and FCS            (verify frame integrity)
    iv)  Decapsulate the frame to get the packet  (remove header and trailer)
    v)   Check destination IP and routing table
          • If not found, send error message
          • If found:
            • Encapsulate packet into frame       (add header and trailer)
            • Transmit frame through correct port (based on MAC address and routing table)

9. What is network media. Explain how it can be classified
  • The physical channels or communication paths used to transmit data between devices on a network.
  • They can be classified as:
      a) Unguided (wireless)
      b) Guided (wired)

10. Explain what traditional and converged networks and are differentiate between the two
  a) Traditional Networks : Uses different technologies, protocols, and devices for each type of network traffic
  b) Converged Networks   : Uses the same technology, protocol, and device for all types of network traffic

11. List and explain the 4 characteristics of reliable networks
    a) Fault Tolerance          : Continue operating even if some of its components fail
    b) Scalability              : Grow in size and complexity without losing performance
    c) Security                 : Protect its data from unauthorized access
    d) Quality of Service (QoS) : Provide different levels of service to different types of traffic

12. What are network protocols and why are they important?
  • They are a set of rules and standards that govern the formatting, transmission, and receipt of data on a network.
  • Network protocols are important because they help to:
      a) Establish and maintain the rules for communication 
      b) Ensure that data is transmitted securely and efficiently.

13. What are reference and layered models and why are they important?
  • A conceptual framework that provides a common language and structure for network communication
  • It is used to understand how different components of a network work together to transfer data between devices
  • Such a model typically defines:
      a) The format/structure of a message
      b) How networking devices share pathway information
      c) How and when error/system messages are generated
      d) The setup and termination of a connection

  ‣ Some benefits of using a layered model are:
    • Provides a common language                        (e.g. "layer 1" means the same thing to everyone)
    • Eliminates competition between different vendors  (e.g. all vendors use the same model)
    • Changes in one layer do not affect other layers   (e.g. changes in layer 1 do not affect layer 2)

14. Explain and differentiate between the TCP/IP and OSI 7-layer models.

  a) ISO/OSI Model
    1) Application Layer  : Provides services to applications (e.g. HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.)
    2) Presentation Layer : Formatting data for presentation to the application layer (e.g. encryption, compression)
    3) Session Layer      : Responsible for establishing and managing connections between devices
    4) Transport Layer    : Ensuring reliable delivery by including error detection and correction (e.g. TCP, UDP)
    5) Network Layer      : Routes data packets between devices on different networks (e.g. IP, ICMP, etc.)
    6) Data Link Layer    : Transfers data frames between devices over a physical link (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)
    7) Physical Layer     : Transfers bits over a physical medium, such as a cable or wireless connection (copper, fiber)

  b) TCP/IP Model
    1) Application Layer    : Protocols that support specific network applications (e.g. HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.)
    2) Transport Layer      : Ensuring reliable delivery by including error detection and correction (e.g. TCP, UDP)
    3) Internet Layer       : Routes data packets between devices on different networks (e.g. IP, ICMP, etc.)
    4) Network Access Layer : Transfers data frames between devices over a physical link (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)

  • The TCP/IP model is more streamlined and better suited for modern networks
  • The OSI model is more theoretical and has less practical application in modern network design.
