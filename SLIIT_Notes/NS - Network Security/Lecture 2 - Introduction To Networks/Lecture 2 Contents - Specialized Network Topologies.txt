Specialist Network Topologies: Network topologies that are tailored for special needs, used in HPC environments

  a) Fat tree: A tree topology with multiple layers of switches which are connected to each other
     • At the top of the tree are the 'core' switches (high-performance and expensive switches)
     • The core switches are connected to the 'aggregation' switches in the next layer.
     • Which in turn are connected to the 'edge' switches in the bottom layer.
     • All switches in a layer are fully-connected
     • Provides high bandwidth, high scalability (can add switches), and high availability (fully connected switches)
     • Generally expensive to implement

  b) Torus: Each device is connected to its horizantal and veritcal neighbour (froming a 3D mesh topology)
     • Can be thought of as multiple mesh networks that are connected together
     • Provides high bandwidth, high scalability (can add nodes), and high availability (traffic can be re-routed)
     • More compled adn expensive to implement than other topologies

  c) Dragonfly: Multiple mesh networks are fully-connected to each other (A mesh network of mesh networks)
     • Creates many different paths for data to travel between computers.
     • This can help speed up communication and reduce delays
     • Adding a node requires connecting it to all other nodes in the network, which is expensive

  d) Hypercube: A network of multiple cube-shaped topologies (used in parallel computing environments)
     • Each node is connected to its neighbours forming a cube
     • Each cube is connected to other cubes forming a bigger cube (hypercube)
     • Provides high bandwidth, high scalability, high availability, and is easier to configure routing protocols
     • Determining optimal routing paths and addressing schemes can be difficult
