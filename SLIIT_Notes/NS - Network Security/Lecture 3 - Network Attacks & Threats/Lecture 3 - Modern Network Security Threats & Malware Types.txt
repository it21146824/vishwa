i) Network Security
  a) Vulnerability: A weakness in a network that can be exploited by a hacker to gain access to the network.
    ‣ Examples:
      a) A vulnerable service running on a server
      b) Open ports on a firewall
      c) Lack of physical security

  b) Threat: The possibility of a hacker exploiting a vulnerability to gain access to a network.
    ‣ Threat agent: A person/entity attempting to exploit a vulnerability
    • For example:
      i) A tornado (threat agent) wiping out a facility (vulnerability)
      ii) A disgruntled employee (threat agent) stealing data (vulnerability)

  c) Risk & Exposure:
    ‣ Exposure : The amount of vulnerability that is exposed to a threat agent (webserver has many open ports)
    ‣ Risk     : The chance of a threat agent exploiting a vulnerability & it's impact (webserver being exploited)

  d) Mitigation:
    ‣ Countermeasures that can be taken to reduce the risk of a threat agent exploiting a vulnerability
    • For example:
      1) Access control mechanisms in an operating system
      2) A security guard
      3) Security awareness training

ii) Vectors of network attacks: The path in which a threat agent can gain access to a network
    a) Internal: Exploits a vulnerability from within the network (e.g. a disgruntled employee)
    b) External: Exploits a vulnerability from outside the network (e.g. a black-hat hacker)

iii) Vectors of data loss: The ways in which data can be lost/stolen/leaked to the outside world
    • Email/webmail           : Email sent to the wrong person
    • Unencrypted devices     : A laptop is stolen which contains sensitive data
    • Cloud storage devices   : The Azure cloud is hacked & sensitive data is leaked
    • Removable media         : A USB stick is attached to a computer & the data is copied to it
    • Improper access control : A user has access to data they shouldn't have access to

iv) Types of hackers
  a) White hat hackers: Exploits vulnerabilities in a network to test the security of the network
  b) Black hat hackers: Illegally exploits vulnerabilities in a network to gain access to the network
  c) Grey hat hackers : A mix between white and black hat hackers who do arguably illegal things
  d) Hacktivists      : A hacker who hacks a network to make a political statement
  e) Vulnerability brokers    : People who sell vulnerabilities to black hat hackers
  f) State sponsored hackers  : A government sponsored hacker who exploits vulnerabilities in a network

v) Types of malware
  i) Traditional malware: Malware that has been around for a long time and is still used today.
    a) Virus        : Duplicates itself by infecting other files or programs on a computer
    b) Worm         : Can spread itself over computer networks, and exploit security vulnerabilities
    c) Trojan Horse : Disguised as a legitimate program or file but actually contains malicious code

  ii) Modern malware: Malware that has been developed recently.
    a) Ransomware : Encrypts a victim's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key
    a) Spyware    : Designed to collect data from a computer system without the user's knowledge or consent
    a) Adware     : Displays unwanted advertisements on a computer system
    a) Phishing   : Emails tricking users into clicking on a link/attachment that contains malicious code
    a) Rootkits   : Hides itself from antivirus software and gives the attacker full control of the computer
