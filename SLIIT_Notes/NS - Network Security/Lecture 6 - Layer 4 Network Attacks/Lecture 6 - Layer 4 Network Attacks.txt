I) Tasks Of The Transport Layer
  a) Connection-Oriented Communication        : Two machines must establish a connection before communication
  b) Application-To-Application Data Delivery : Delivers data from the source application to the destination application
  c) Port Addressing                          : Each application on a machine has a unique port number

  d) Flow Controlling
    i)  Error Handling      : Detects and retransmits lost or corrupted data
    ii) Window Controlling  : Data is transmitted at a rate based on the available network bandwidth/capacity
  e) Reliable Data Delivery : Reliable data delivery by using error detection and correction mechanisms

II) TCP Control Bits
  a) URG: Urgent Pointer Field          (Indicates that the data is urgent)
  b) ACK: Acknowledgement Number Field  (Confirms that it got the data)
  c) PSH: Push Function                 (Pushes the data to the application layer immediately)
  d) RST: Reset Connection              (Resets the connection)
  e) SYN: Synchronize Sequence Numbers  (Establishes a connection)
  f) FIN: No More Data From Sender      (Finishes a connection)

III) TCP Attacks
  a) TCP Port Scans           : The attacker sends TCP SYN packets to a port to see if it is open
  b) TCP Port Scans (Stealth) : Uses FIN, SYN-FIN, NULL, PUSH, or fragmented packets to stay undetected
  c) TCP Host Sweeps          : A TCP port scan on a range of IP addresses
  d) OS Fingerprinting        : Identifying the target's operating system based on the TCP responses
  e) TCP Hijacking Attacks    : Hijacking a TCP session by intercepting and modifying packets in transit
  f) TCP SYN Flood            : Overwhelming a target system with a flood of TCP SYN packets
    • The attacker sends a lot of SYN requests, but does not respond with an ACK
    • Every SYN request is saved in the 'incomplete connection queue' until acknowledged
    • Sending a lot of unacknowledged SYNs will overload this queue, resulting in a DOS

IV) UDP Attacks
  a) UDP Flood Attack : The attacker sends a large number of UDP packets to a target system making it unresponsive

  b) UDP Bomb Attack  : The length specified in the UDP header is less than the length specified in the IP header
    • UDP is sent using the IP protocol (UDP/IP) and both have a lenth header to specify the length of the packet
    • Ideally, both the length headers should be the same
    • If the length specified in the UDP header is less than what is specified in the IP header, a buffer will overflow
