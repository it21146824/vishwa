1) Information Security: Concerned with protecting digital information from unauthorized access
  ‣ Examples:
    • Encrypting sensitive files or data to protect them from unauthorized access
    • Using strong, unique passwords to prevent unauthorized access to online accounts
    • Implementing access controls to limit who has permission to view or modify certain information
    • Regularly backing up data to prevent loss in the event of a security breach or system failure
    • Conducting security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities and address them before they can be exploited

2) Network Security: Concerned with securing the connections and infrastructure used to transmit information
  ‣ Examples:
    • Configuring firewalls to block unauthorized access to a network
    • Implementing intrusion detection and prevention systems to identify and respond to potential threats
    • Setting up virtual private networks (VPNs) to create secure connections between remote users and a company's network
    • Conducting regular network scans to identify potential vulnerabilities and address them before they can be exploited
    • Using network segmentation to isolate critical systems or data from less secure areas of the network

3) Cybersecurity: Concerned with protecting systems from a wide range of cyber threats, including hacking, viruses, and other malicious attacks
  ‣ Examples:
    • Conducting security awareness training for employees to help them recognize and avoid potential cyber threats
    • Implementing multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security to online accounts
    • Responding to security incidents such as data breaches or ransomware attacks
    • Conducting forensic investigations to identify the source and extent of a security breach
    • Developing and implementing incident response plans to minimize the impact of a security incident and prevent it from happening again.
