A) IP Attacks:
  I) ICMP Sweep       : Pings a range of IP addresses
  II) ICMP Redirect   : Used by routers to inform hosts that there is a better route to a destination machine
    • Attackers can use this to redirect traffic to a machine under their control (Man-in-the-middle attack)

  III) IP Spoofing: Changing the IP packet's source address and sending it to a victim machine
    a) Session Hacking With Non-blind Spoofing: Changing the source IP to a trusted machine's and taking over it's session
    b) IP Spoofing With Source Routing        : The attacker can change the source IP and also specify the destination route
    b) Blind Spoofing: Attacker changes the source IP to a fake IP and sends packets to a victim (will not receive responses)
      • For every sender's request, a response is sent back from the receiver to the sender's IP (source IP)
      • The source IP is changed to a fake IP, so the attacker will never get a reply (as the reply is sent to the fake IP)
      • This is used to launch further attacks without being detected

  IV) Ping Of Death : A large oversized ping packet (size in MBs) is sent to a victim, causing it to crash
  V)  Ping Flood    : A huge quantity of pings are sent to a victim, causing it to crash

  VI) Smurf Attack: A large number of pings are sent to a network's broadcast address, using a spoofed source IP address
      • The source IP belongs to a machine on the victim's network
      • This will cause all hosts on the network to reply to the ping, flooding the victim's network (DOS)

  VII) TTL-Based Attacks: TTL is a header which specifies the number of router hops a packet can take before being discarded

    a) TTL Expiry Attack: A lot of low-TTL packets are sent to a router (forcing it to reply when the TTL reaches 0)
      • When a TTL reaches 0, the router sends an ICMP TTL Exceeded message back to the source IP
      • If a lot of these packets are sent, the router has to reply to all these packets, causing it to crash

    b) Fragmentation Based Attacks
      • An IP packet can be broken into multiple fragments before sending
      • If a fragment reaches an NIDS (intrusion detection), but drops at the router (due to TTL being 0), the NIDS will:
          1) Hold the fragment until that fragment is retransmitted
          2) Discard the fragment if it is not retransmitted within a certain time period (Fragment Reassembly Timeout)

      i) TTL-Based Evasion Attack: Fragment are sent in the wrong order by setting their TTL to 0 (to bypass NIDS)
        • A big packet can be broken into a number of fragments (lets consider 3 fragments for example)
        • For example, The second fragment must have a TTL of 1 less than the number of hops needed to reach the router
            1) The first fragment is sent normally, scanned by the NIDS, and forwarded to the router
            2) The second fragment has a low TTL, so it reaches the NIDS, but drops at the router
            3) Since the second fragment dropped at the router, it is not reassembled, and the NIDS holds it in a buffer
            4) The third fragment is sent normally, scanned by the NIDS, and forwarded to the router
            5) The second fragment is now retransmitted, and reaches the NIDS
            6) The NIDS forwards the second fragment, as needed fragments (1 & 3) are not available for reassembly (and scanning)
            7) If all 3 fragments were sent normally, the NIDS will assemble all 3, and will not forward if malicious

      ii) Overlapping Fragments Attack: IP fragments are crafted based on an OS's filter policies
          a) Policy First : Only the first set of sent fragments are reassembled
          b) Policy last  : Only the last set of sent fragments are reassembled
          • A NIDS (intrusion detection) might assemble only for the first set of fragments (Policy First)
          • But a victim may assemble only the last set of received fragments (Policy Last)
          • An attacker can bypass the NIDS by sending legit data in the first fragments, and malicious data in the last
            1) The attacker sends a valid initial set of fragments that the NIDS scans (using Policy First)
            2) The victim waits until it receives the last set of fragments to reassemble the entire packet (using Policy Last)
            3) The attacker sends modified first fragments + last fragment (which the NIDS ignores as it uses Policy First)
            4) The victim reassembles the malicious fragment + last fragment (as it uses Policy Last)
            5) The attacker has now successfully bypassed the NIDS and sent malicious packets to the victim

      iii) Tear-Drop Attack: Exploits the fact that a target system holds a buffer for each IP fragment
        1) Attacker sends fragmented IP packets with overlapping data and incorrect fields.
        2) Target system begins reassembly upon receiving packets.
        3) First packet is stored in a buffer by target system.
        4) Second packet has overlapping payload and incorrect fields.
        5) Target system becomes confused and attempts to store overlapping payload.
        6) Third packet may also have overlapping payload and incorrect fields.
        7) Target system becomes overwhelmed and may crash or become unresponsive.
        8) Target system cannot process legitimate traffic, causing a DoS attack.

B) Routing Attacks:
  I)  Routing Table Overflow  : A large number of fake routing updates are sent to a router, leaving no room for legit routes
  II) Routing Table Poisoning : Fake routing updates with routes containing malicious destinations are sent to a router
