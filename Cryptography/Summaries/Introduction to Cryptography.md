#### Terminology
1. **[[Symmetric Cryptography|Symmetric Ciphers]]**: The same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message.
2. **Asymmetric Ciphers**: Two keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the message.
3. **Hybrid Schemes**: The usage of both asymmetric ciphers and symmetric ciphers.
4. **[[Symmetric Cryptography|Plaintext]]**: Text that still has not been encrypted.
5. **[[Symmetric Cryptography|Ciphertext]]**: Plaintext that is now encrypted.
6. **[[Cryptanalysis]]**: The study of how to break cryptographic algorithms.
7. **[[Cryptanalysis|Kerckhoff's Principle]]**: The security of a cryptographic algorithm should not depend on the secrecy of the algorithm.
8. **[[Substitution Cipher|Brute-force Attacks]]**: Trying all possible keys to find the correct one (also known as Known-Plaintext Attacks).
9. **[[Substitution Cipher|Exhaustive Key Search]]**: A similar word for brute-force attacks.
10. **[[Substitution Cipher|Frequency Analysis]]**: Trying to crack a cipher by observing the most repeated letters in the ciphertext.
10. **[[Substitution Cipher]]**: A cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext with another letter.
11. **[[Modular Arithmetic]]**: Deals with remainders when two numbers are divided by an integer called the modulus
12. **[[Number Systems]]**: A scheme used to represent integers.
13. **[[Prime Numbers]]**: A positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1.
