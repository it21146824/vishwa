#### Terminology
1. **Symmetric Ciphers**: The same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message.
2. **Asymmetric Ciphers**: Two keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the message.
3. **Hybrid Schemes**: The usage of both asymmetric ciphers and symmetric ciphers.
4. **Plaintext**: Text that still has not been encrypted.
5. **Ciphertext**: Plaintext that is now encrypted.
6. **Cryptanalysis**: The study of how to break cryptographic algorithms.
7. **Kerckhoff's Principle**: The security of a cryptographic algorithm should not depend on the secrecy of the algorithm.
8. **Brute-force Attacks**: Trying all possible keys to find the correct one (also known as Known-Plaintext Attacks).
9. **Exhaustive Key Search**: A similar word for brute-force attacks.
10. **Substitution Cipher**: A cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext with another letter.
