### Prime Numbers

+ A prime number is a positive integer that is **divisible only by itself and 1**. In other words, it is a number that is not divisible by any other number except for 1 and itself.
+ For example, the first few prime numbers are **2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13**.

#### Properties of Prime Numbers

1. Prime numbers are **odd numbers except the number 2**.
2. All positive **integers can be expressed as a product of prime numbers** in a unique way, known as the **prime factorization**.

#### Prime Factorization
+ This is the process of **breaking down a number into its prime factors**.
+ Below are the numbers **$42$, $54$, and $522$** broken down into prime factors:
    + **$42 = 2 \times 3 \times 7$**
    + **$54 = 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$**
    + **$522 = 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 29$**
