### Greatest Common Denominator
+ Finding out **the greatest integer that divides two integers** without leaving a remainder.
+ It is notated by: **$gcd(a, b)$**.

#### How To Find GCD
1. **Greatest Common Factor**
    1. Find the numbers that divide both numbers without leaving a remainder.
    2. Find the **common factors**.
    3. The **largest common factor** is the GCD.
        + For example, $gcd(12, 18)$:
        + $12 = 1, 2, 3, 4,$ **$6$**, $12$
        + $18 = 1, 2, 3,$ **$6$**$, 9, 18$
        + $gcd(12, 18) = 6$

2. **Prime Factorization**
    1. Find the prime factorization of both numbers.
    2. Multiply the common prime factors.
    3. The product is the GCD.
        + For example, $gcd(12, 18)$:
            + $12 =$ **$2$** $\cdot 2 \cdot$ **$3$**
            + $18 =$ **$2$** $\cdot$ **$3$** $\cdot 3$
            + $gcd(12, 18) = 2 \cdot 3 = 6$

3. **Euclidean Algorithm**
