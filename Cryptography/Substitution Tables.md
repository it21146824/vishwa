### An Overview Substitution Tables
+ This is a table that contains a **one-to-one mapping for all letters** in the alphabet which **maps a letter to a another letter**. The following is an example of a substitution table of a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3:

| Plain | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cipher | Q | W | E | R | T | Y | U | I | O | P | A | S | D | F | G | H | J | K | L | Z | X | C | V | B | N | M |

+ **'A'** is replaced with **'Q'**
+ **'B'** is replaced with **'W'**
+ **'C'** is replaced with **'E'**
+ **'D'** is replaced with **'R'**

+ **'X'** is replaced with **'B'**
