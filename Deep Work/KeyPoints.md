# Key Points

# Deep Work vs Shallow Work
+ Shallow work refers to unproductive work such as:
    1. Responding to emails
    2. Doing labour that can be automated
    3. Getting distracted on social media

+ Deep work refers to the amount of **creative uninterrupted work hours** a person can pull off.
+ Anything that you do to qualify as *Deep Work* should meet the following criteria:
    1. You should have **zero** distractions from the time you start your work to the time you end your work.
    2. A machine should not be able to replicate the work you do.
    3. You should aim to do better/more than what your competitors do.

+ The book explains that to achieve a state of deep work, you should first identify all the shallow work you do and eliminate them. If some shallow work are absolutely necessary in your life, it is advised to group all those shallow work together and sprint them in a short period of time.
+ You should do shallow work and deep work together, as that is the definition of being distracted.

# Three Types of People Surviving This Economy
1. Those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines
2. Those who are the best at what they do
3. Those with access to capital

+ The book labels that point `1` and point `2` are accessible to the average person as point `3` requires you to have capital, which may not be the case with everyone. The book says that the following qualities should be developed in a person to fall into one of these two categories:
1. The ability to quickly master hard things
    + The ability to quickly learn hard things is an evergreen skill. Its not the process of just learning one skill, its the *ability* to learn difficult skills. Technology is growing and you will be outdated if you cannot learn new difficult skills. Therefore, the ability to learn a difficult skill is evergreen and important.
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.
    + The path to that should be taken to achieve these abilities is: *deliberate practice* as the book mentions. A person should enter a state of deep work with zero distractions in order to produce at an elite level.
    + *Producing at an elite level* refers to producing software such as Ruby on Rails, nothing less, as the book mentions.

+ The reason that deep work is so important for productivity is that, research has shown that even a small distraction such as a notification which shifts your attention, will delay your output time by a significant amount. Also, it is recommended not to do two tasks simultaneously (multi-tasking).

# Multi Tasking & Attention Residue
+ Multi-tasking implies that you do not give your entire attention to one task, and thus, breaking the rule of deep work. Multi-tasking creates *attention residue*.

### Attention Residue
+ When you try to deeply work on two things at a time, you will find that once you switch tasks, you still have thoughts of the previous tasks in mind, even if you have completed it.
+ This is harmful to productivity as you will not be able to give your full focus to one task.
+ This is basically the idea of **attention-residue**.

### Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity
+ The book mentions that people often confuse busyness with productivity. Just because you are busy, does not mean you are productive.
+ The book states that many companies provide salaries/promotions based on productivity, but they do not have a criteria for measuring productivity, other than how busy they *visibly* look.
+ It would be great to have a numeric metric (and a feedback loop) to measure and guide your productivity *(such as the h-index for a researcher)*.

### The Principle of Least Resistance
+ If you do not have a feedback loop to measure your productivity, you will do the easiest thing at hand, even though it does not yield the most results. Some examples are:
1. Procrastination with Tasks
2. Choosing Familiar Tasks Over Learning New Skills
3. Overusing Social Media or Entertainment for Downtime
4. Skipping Exercise for Easier Activities
