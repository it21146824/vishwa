# Workflow Orchestration
+ **Orchestration**: The automation of multiple steps in a deployment process.
    + It is the automation of automation (eg: automating deploying a VM in the cloud)

# CI/CD
+ **Continuous Integration**: A software development method where code updates are tested and commited to a development or build server/code repository rapidly.
    + Checks for errors in code commits and addresses them early.

+ **Continuous Delivery**: A software development method where applications and platform requirements are frequently tested and validated for immediate availability.
    + Checks if the code is deployable in the current state.

+ **Continuous Deployement**: A software development method where application and platform updates are commited to production rapidly.
    + Checks if the code is deployable in the current state, and deploys it if it is.

# DevSecOps
+ **DevOps**: When both the development team and operations team work together to create a product.
    + The development team creates the product, and the operations team deploys the product.

+ **DevSecOps**: Same as DevOps, but with security personnel involved.
    + The development team creates the product, the security team ensures the product is secure, and the operations team deploys the product.

# Infrastructure as Code (IAC)
+ The usage of scripts to automate the deployment of infrastructure (ex: deployment of AWS EC2 instances).
    + This provides security, consistency, and scalability.

+ **Snowflake Systems**: These are custom systems that are difficult to maintain and scale because they are unique and require a lot of manual work to maintain.
    + **Idempotence**: The ability to run the same script multiple times without causing issues.
    + If a slowflake system is not idempotent, then it is difficult to maintain and scale.

# Machine Learning
+ **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The science of creating machines with the ability to develop problem solving and analysis strategies without significant human direction or intervention.
+ **Machine Learning**: A component of AI, which learns from labelled datasets to make predictions.
    + **Artifical Neural Network (ANN)**: An architecture of input, hidden and output layers that can be trained to make predictions.

+ **Deep Learning**: An extension of machine learning, but does not require manual feature extraction.
