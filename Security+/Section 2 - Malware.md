# Malware
+ Malware is software designed to infiltrate a computer system without its user's content with the intent to damage it.
+ Some of the following are examples of malware:
    1. **Viruses**
    2. **Worms**
    3. **Trojan Horses**
    4. **Ransomware**
    5. **Spyware**
    6. **Rootkits**
    7. **Spam**

# Virus
+ This is a type of malware that is designed to reproduce and spread after a user action occurs (*installing the malware*).
+ Viruses are separated into 10 types:
    1. **Boot sector**: *Viruses stored in the first sector of a hard drive when booting up*.
    2. **Macro**: *Viruses stored in documents which are executed on opening*.
    3. **Program**: *Executable applications that contain malicious code*.
    4. **Mulitpartite**: *A combination of boot sector & program virus. The virus stays in the boot sector, so that whenever the installed program virus is deleted, the boot sector re-installs the program virus*.
    5. **Encrypted**: *The virus encrypts itself to avoid anti-virus detection*.
    6. **Polymorphic**: *An encrypted virus that changes its decryption module every time it is run to avoid anti-virus detection*.
    7. **Metamorphic**: *A polymorphic virus that rewrites itself completely every time it is run to avoid anti-virus detection*.
    8. **Stealth**: *A virus that uses various techniques mentioned above to avoid detection*.
    9. **Armored**: *Viruses that are protected by encryption and/or obfuscation to avoid detection*.
    10. **Hoax**: *Software such as 'download free RAM' that will install*.

# Worms
+ Worms are similar io viruses, but they do not need user interaction to replicate themselves and spread.
+ Some examples of popular worms are nimda & conficker.

# Trojan Horse
+ A malware that has looks like legitimate software, but has malicious code hidden inside.
+ It will perform both desired functions and malicious functions.
+ A **remote access trojan (RAT)** will allow an attacker to remotely control a system.
+ A tool that allows the creation of trojan horses is JPS (Virus Maker 3.0) and ProRat for RATs.

# Ransomware
+ This is malware that encrypts files on a system and demands a ransom to decrypt them.
+ It is advised not to pay the ransom as there is no guarantee that the files will be decrypted.

# Spyware
+ This is malware that is designed to spy on a user's activity to profile a user.
+ This is then fed into Adware, which is displaying advertisements based on the user's profile.
+ Grayware is a term used to describe software that is not malicious, but is unwanted (like the mouse hovering all over the screen)
+ A keylogger is an example of spyware.

# Rootkit
+ These is a software that attempts to gain root-level permissions on remote systems
+ They achieve this by trying to reach level 0 of the OS (Kernel Level) and then modifying the OS to gain root-level permissions.
+ The following are ways in which attackers can achieve this:
    1. **DLL Injection**: *Injecting malicious code into a DLL file, which will get loaded into memory*.
    2. **Driver Manipulation**: *Replacing a legitimate driver with a malicious one, compromising the kernel-mode*.
+ Both these techniques place a **shim** in the kernel, which is a piece of code that is loaded into memory and is used to intercept system calls.
+ Rootkits are activated when the system boots up, and are therefore difficult to detect.

# Spam
+ These are advertisements and other unwanted messages sent to a user's email.
+ Spammers use open email-relaying servers to send spam.
+ However, the CAN-SPAM act of 2003 will fine open-relay server providers if their servers were sending emails.
+ **SPIM (Spam over Instant Messaging)** is a type of spam that is sent over instant messaging services.
